# Zara-FunProjects
My small coding projects!

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JS


## Includes:
1- Form Validation: in which I tried to consider all possible input controls in a register form. 

2- Seat Booking: a UI to reserve seats in a simulated cinema plan and get the total price based on the selected movie (these are the four movies  I really enjoy watching!). My challenge here was to save data in localStorage to have them back in every page reloading. 

3- Video Player: a practice to customize "video" tag in html file without using "controls" attribute.

4- Currency Converter: a UI to convert currencies by fetching data. 

5-List: a practice to create a list of persons with their wealth using fetch API, and then sorting them, adding to the list, calculating the total wealth, etc.

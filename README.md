# Zara-FunProjects

My small coding projects!

## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, JS

## Includes:

1- **[Form Validation](https://codepen.io/zaaraa-z/pen/wvdXvPy)**: in which I tried to consider all possible input controls in a register form.

2- **[Seat Booking](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/seat-booking)**: a UI to reserve seats in a simulated cinema plan and get the total price based on the selected movie (these are the four movies I really enjoy watching!). My challenge here was to save data in localStorage to have them back in every page reloading.

3- **[Video Player](https://codepen.io/zaaraa-z/details/xxdybXb)**: a practice to customize "video" tag in html file without using "controls" attribute.

4- **[Currency Converter](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/currency-converter)**: a UI to convert currencies by fetching data.

5-**[List](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/list)**: a practice to create a list of persons with their wealth using fetch API, and then sorting them, adding to the list, calculating the total wealth, etc.

6- **[Menu Slider & Modal](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/menu-slider-&-modal)**: a simple website width a vertical menu slider which can be fold on click, and a customised modal to login.

7- **["Guess Word" game](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/guess-word)** (a fun version of Hangman game): I tought, well, "Hangman" is not a pleasant name, AT ALL. It is not a joke to play a game in which you are going to hang a man just like that! So, my challenge was to think of a more delightful graphic and less emotional one! I love gardening, so, I chose this! You will ruin my sunflower if you guess wrong letters. I can live with that though! Seriously! Watching a flower dying is not a big deal in comparison to take a human being life!

**To Do Features:**

- [ ] Fix the typing issue in mobile devices (make the blanks clickable).
- [ ] Fix the bottom message position in mobile devices.

8- **[Meals To Rescue!](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/meals-to-rescue)**: a web app to find out wat to cock when you are helpless! Just enter the food keyword and wait for the results. Then you can click on a special meal to see the recipe. There is also a random button whic is handy when you have no idea!

9- **["Expense Review" app](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/expense-review)**: an app to keep track of your expenses and incomes.

10- **[Music Player](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/music-player)**: a very fun app to play music with cute animations!

**To Do Features:**

- [ ] Check the music lag issue.

11- **Infinite Scrolling** (fetch/load data on scroll): a template for blog or news website in which more data will be fetched when you are scrolling down. You can also search in loaded data for a special letter, word or sentence; whatever you type, the DOM will filter the data based on that.

12- **["Type It Fast" game](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/type-it-fast/)**: a game to measure your typing speed! it has 3 difficulty levels and the timer changes based on your choice. I needed a random word creator API but I didn't find anything for free, so the random words are being created according to an array of words I have provided in the JS file.

13- **["Text to Speech" web app](https://codepen.io/zaaraa-z/pen/LYLqOLM)**: one of the things I remind myself of every now and then is that "You have to develop for the ones with disabilitis first!". I know how it is like to be disable, temporarily. We have to care about people who are limitted. This web app is a simple pne for autistic childs to express their feelings and needs via text and images.

14- **["Memory Cards" app](https://www.zarazamanian.com/demo/memory-cards)**: I really like this one! As a constant learner, I appreciate any tools to help learning more and more. This memory cards app helps you to add your own Q/A. the animations are very lovely. This was the first time I was using these techniques.

**To Do Features:**

- [x] Check the browser compability and solve the Safari issue#1.
- [ ] Add a login system.

18- **["Breakout Game"](https://www.zarazamanian.com/demo/breakout-game)**: wow! I learnt a lot in this project! It is a traditional game in which you should control the ball and break the bricks to win. Try it out!

19- **["New Year Countdown"](https://codepen.io/zaaraa-z/full/OJjZXdj)**: a landing page in which there is a timer showing the remaining days/hours/minutes, and seconds to the coming year!

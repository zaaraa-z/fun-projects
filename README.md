# Zara-FunProjects
My small coding projects!

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JS


## Includes:
1- **[Form Validation](https://codepen.io/zaaraa-z/pen/wvdXvPy)**: in which I tried to consider all possible input controls in a register form. 

2- **[Seat Booking](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/seat-booking)**: a UI to reserve seats in a simulated cinema plan and get the total price based on the selected movie (these are the four movies  I really enjoy watching!). My challenge here was to save data in localStorage to have them back in every page reloading. 

3- **[Video Player](https://codepen.io/zaaraa-z/details/xxdybXb)**: a practice to customize "video" tag in html file without using "controls" attribute.

4- **[Currency Converter](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/currency-converter)**: a UI to convert currencies by fetching data. 

5-**[List](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/list)**: a practice to create a list of persons with their wealth using fetch API, and then sorting them, adding to the list, calculating the total wealth, etc. 

6- **[Menu Slider & Modal](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/menu-slider-&-modal)**: a simple website width a vertical menu slider which can be fold on click, and a customised modal to login. 

7- **["Guess Word" game](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/guess-word)** (a fun version of Hangman game): I tought, well, "Hangman" is not a pleasant name, AT ALL. It is not a joke to play a game in which you are going to hang a man just like that! So, my challenge was to think of a more delightful graphic and less emotional one! I love gardening, so, I chose this! You will ruin my sunflower if you guess wrong letters. I can live with that though! Seriously! Watching a flower dying is not a big deal in comparison to take a human being life!

8- **[Meals To Rescue!](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/meals-to-rescue)**: a web app to find out wat to cock when you are helpless! Just enter the food keyword and wait for the results. Then you can click on a special meal to see the recipe. There is also a random button whic is handy when you have no idea! 

9- **["Expense Review" app](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/expense-review)**: an app to keep track of your expenses and incomes.

10- **[Music Player](https://zarazamanian.com/demo/music-player)**: a very fun app to play music with cute animations!

11- **Infinite Scrolling** (fetch/load data on scroll): a template for blog or news website in which more data will be fetched when you are scrolling down. You can also search in loaded data for a special letter, word or sentence; whatever you type, the DOM will filter the data based on that.

12- **"Type It Fast" game**: 

13- **"Text to Speech" web app**: 

14- **["Memory Cards" app](https://www.zarazamanian.com/demo/memory-cards)**: 

15- **"Serach Lyrics!" app**: I'm working on it!
